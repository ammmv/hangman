# hangman
My Game Development project for the Advanced Coding Program by The Circle. 
I started making my project on the very first day, and I actually finished quite early in the "group project" phase. 
I followed a YouTube tutorial, but there were some errors in my code, over the weeks I figured out how to fix those 
errors and make my game fully functional. I made a hangman game. I input several words, so every time you start the 
game again, you get a new word. I created the hangman images and i figured out how to place them on the screen 
correctly with the help of one of the sessions on the program. I think I've learned a lot in this program and this 
project just comes to show that.
